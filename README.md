### **Testament Not Completing**
- Ensure you have all 7 fragments in your inventory for the specific god.
- Right-click the correct altar center block for that god.
- Verify the complete altar structure is built correctly.
- Check console for debug messages.

### **Heart/Forge Conflict**
- The plugin automatically detects and resolves conflicts between the Heart of the Fallen God and the Mace of Divine Forging.
- Conflicting items are automatically removed and dropped at your location.
- Check `testament.conflicts` settings in `config.yml` to modify this behavior.

### **Lives System Issues**
- Check `testament.lives_system` settings in `config.yml`.
- Use `/testament lives` to check your status.

### **Tutorial Not Starting**
- Check `tutorial.enabled` and `auto_start_for_new_players` in `config.yml`.
- Use `/tutorial start` to manually begin the tutorial.
- Use `/tutorial reset` if the tutorial becomes stuck.

### **Performance Issues**
- Enable performance optimization in `config.yml` under `performance`.
- Adjust `effects.particle_density` to reduce visual effects load.
